        People expect macOS apps to be intuitive, while simultaneously adaptable
        to their workflow through customization and flexibility. Many apps offer
        configurable preferences, customizable interfaces, and alternate ways of
        completing tasks. Windows can often be resized and interface elements
        hidden or repositioned. Tasks can be initiated from toolbars, menus,
        controls, keyboard shortcuts, the Touch Bar, accessibility features, and
        more. A flexible app facilitates learning through discoverability.
